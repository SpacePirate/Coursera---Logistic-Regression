# Exercise 2: Logistic Regression
In this exercise, you will implement logistic regression and apply it to two
different datasets. Before starting on the programming exercise, we strongly
recommend watching the video lectures and completing the review questions
for the associated topics.
<br />
To get started with the exercise, you will need to download the starter
code and unzip its contents to the directory where you wish to complete the
exercise. If needed, use the cd command in Octave/MATLAB to change to
this directory before starting this exercise.
<br />
You can also find instructions for installing Octave/MATLAB in the 
Environment Setup Instructions" of the course website.
